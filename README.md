# Airbnb-analysis
In this project I analyzed three neighbourhoods Riverside, Old Town, and Downtown to determine which area is the most profitable and what factors contribute to its revenue. The analysis considers key metrics such as price per night, occupancy rate, and estimated monthly revenue. 
Findings
Riverside generates the highest monthly revenue ($4747.50)due to its high price per night ($211.0) and strong occupancy rate (0.75).

Old Town achieves the highest occupancy rate (0.85) but earns($2061.45) less than Riverside because of its lower price per night ($82.5).

Downtown has both the lowest price per night ($59.0) and lowest occupancy rate (0.52), resulting in the least revenue (920.40)
Conclusion
Revenue is influenced more by price per night than occupancy rate alone.
Even though Old Town has more bookings, Riverside is more profitable because of its higher pricing strategy.
